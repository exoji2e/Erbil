Freestyle Libre is a wearable sensor that measures the glucose level through the blood plasma.

Sugartop is an android app that logs the data from your Freestyle Libre sensors.

## Data integrity
Sugartop puts you in control of your own data by only saving it locally, and letting you export it either as a csv-file or as the raw database.

## Features
- Supports multiple sensors as the same time.
- Calibrate your sensor with manually entered glucose readings.
- Free and Open Source Software.

## Warning:
- If you actually end up using this app, it's your responsibility to take care of your diabetes. If the app does not work properly I take no responsibility, yadayada. If something is not working as intended, post an issue, or a pull request.

- Use only when the sensor has been activated. I've not yet looked into what data is sent when the sensor starts, trying to poll data before a sensor is activated might disable or damage the sensor.
