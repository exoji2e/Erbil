# 'Erbil' == reverse('librE')

Free Style Libre is a wearable sensor that measures the glucose level through the blood plasma.

As a diabetic one currently has two options; always carry with you an extra device with dimentions of a really onld mobile phone, or use your mobile phone, but accept some really shitty user agreements where you don't own your data.

Well, I chose another path. Reverse Enginnering. (Ok hold on, I just started)

Erbil aims to increase accessibility of bloodsugar data for diabetics using a Free Style Libre sensor. If you want another view of your bloodsugar data. Code it up, and have a live-view using this app.

If you actually end up using this app, it's you responsibility to take care of your diabetes. If the app does not work propely I take no responsibility, yadayada. If something is not working as intended, post an issue, or a pull request.

### Todo in readme:
- Installation / setup of env in Android Studio
- Describe how it works, (me patternmatching)
